# GrubDash backend
## Using the application

### Preparing the backend
Download the zip file (or clone the repository), and extract to a folder of your choice.
Enter the folder where you stored the application files and run the following command:
> npm install

After everything has been installed you can run:
>npm start

and the application will automatically spin up a server on your local machine (Port 5000).

### Downloading the frontend
Go to https://github.com/jddolvin/GrubDash-frontend/, and follow the instructions there.
In the instructions, it states to set the `API_BASE_URL`. You do not need to do this, as this application will automatically spin up a server on `localhost:5000.`
